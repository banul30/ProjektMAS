## MAS University Project - Java
This Java application was developed for my university's Design and Analysis of Information Systems (Modelowanie i Analiza System√≥w informacyjnych MAS) course. This 'complex' project required the creation of a minimum of 12-15 logical business classes, implementing variety of object-oriented constructs, such as inheritance, composition, and association. The software features a user-friendly GUI, and it adheres to principles of software design and usability.
